# LAB: Stochastic Gradient Descent SOLUTIONS

The objective of this lab session is to implement and test:
- Stochastic gradient descent with constant stepsizes
- Stochastic gradient descent with shrinking stepsizes
- Stochastic gradient descent with sampling with/without replacement
- Stochastic gradient descent with averaging
- Stochastic gradient descent with momentum

and compare this implementation with gradient descent.
